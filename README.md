## Setting Up
```python
import torch
from pipelines import DiffusionPipeline

base_model = "black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev"
pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(base_model, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)

lora_repo = "strangerzonehf/Flux-Icon-Kit-LoRA"
trigger_word = "Icon Kit"  
pipe.load_lora_weights(lora_repo)

device = torch.device("cuda")
pipe.to(device)
```
## Trigger words

You should use `Icon Kit` to trigger the image generation.
